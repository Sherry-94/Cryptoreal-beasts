**Smart Contract guidelines**

We use these [guidelines](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html) to write smart contracts. In particular, we do not try to prevent stupid behaviors at the contract level but leave this task to the UI. Letting the possibility to a user to harm itself is not a vulnerability (but should of course be dealt at the UI level).

Violation of guidelines are not vulnerabilities but can be reported as "suggestion for tips".
